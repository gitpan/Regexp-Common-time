Regexp::Common::time v0.01
==========================

This is a Regexp::Common plugin that provides regular expressions for
parsing dates and times.  It can handle most date formats, such as:

      y/m/d               m/d/y               d/m/y
    2005/04/02          4/2/2005            2/4/05
    05.04.02            04.02.05            02.04.2005
    2005 April 2        April 2, 2005       2 APR 05
    05APRIL02           APR022005           02 April 2005
    20050402            040205              02042005

It can also handle time formats like:

    9:03:27pm
    21:03:27
    9:03 p.m.
    21:03
    9:03a

Furthermore, you can easily piece together time and date component
patterns (in the style of Time::Format or POSIX's strftime) to build
arbitrarily complex custom regexes that can parse just about any time
or date pattern imaginable.


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand new module.  It has a decent test suite, but it has
not been extensively field-tested.  So use it with caution.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Regexp::Common::time
surprises you, I would be grateful if you could send me an email
message about it.  Thanks.
